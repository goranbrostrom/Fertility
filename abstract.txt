G. Broström. The effect of socioeconomic status on marital fertility during
the demographic transition, northern Sweden 1821-1950: Efficient data analysis 
with a process point of view. 

The change of impact of the family's socioeconomic status at marriage on
later child births during the demographic transition is studied on data
from Umeå (1901-1950) and Skellefteå (1821-1950), two regions in the north
of Sweden. The statistical modeling is done in the framework of counting
(birth) processes, with a couple of choices to contemplate: Which time
scale, and how to handle the dynamic aspects of the counting process. The
theoretic framework in the analysis embraces counting processes and Cox
regression with dynamic covariates. Data come from The Demographic Data
Base, Centre for Demographic and Ageing Research at Umeå University,
Sweden. Statistical sufficiency is an old concept that is revived for data 
reduction and efficient analysis of tables.
