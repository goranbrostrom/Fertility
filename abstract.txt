G. Broström. The effect of socioeconomic status on marital fertility during
the demographic transition, northern Sweden 1821-1950. 

The change of impact of the family's socioeconomic status at marriage on
later child births during the demographic transition is studied on data
from Umeå (1901-1950) and Skellefteå (1821-1950), two regions in the north
of Sweden. The statistical modeling is done in the framework of counting
(birth) processes, with a couple of choices to contemplate: Which time
scale, and how to handle the dynamic aspects of the counting process. The
theoretic framework in the analysis embraces counting processes and Cox
regression with dynamic covariates. Data come from The Demographic Data
Base, Centre for Demographic and Ageing Research at Umeå University,
Sweden. All women in the data set, married in the regions and born between
1 January 1801 and 31 December 1900, are included in the analysis. For each
woman, the exact timing of her deliveries (if any) after the onset of the
first marriage are recorded.
